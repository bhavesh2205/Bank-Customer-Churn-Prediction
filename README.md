# Bank Customer Churn Model

### Problem Statment: 
Customer churn is a significant challenge for banks and financial institutions. Churn occurs when customers stop using a bank's services, leading to a loss of revenue and potentially damaging the bank's reputation. Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for banks to take proactive measures to retain customers and enhance their services.

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn. By analyzing various features such as customer demographics, account information, and transaction history, we aim to gain insights into the factors contributing to churn and develop strategies to mitigate it.
